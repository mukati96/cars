                        The company is following the technical/administrative measures below to ensure a high level of safety
                        regarding the handling of the user’s personal information, making sure that the information is not lost,
                        stolen, leaked, manipulated, or damaged during the process.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="mt-4 pl-2">A. Encryption of Personal Information</h5>
                    <p> Personal information of the users is stored after going through an encryption process. The files and transfer data are also encrypted to make sure the user’s personal information is not leaked even in the case of an unexpected accident.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-4 pl-2">B. Countermeasures (Hacking, Cyber Attacks)</h5>
                    <p>The company is doing its best to prevent the user’s personal information from being leaked or
                        damaged by external attacks (hacking) or viruses. The company is frequently backing up data, using up-to-date vaccine programs/services to prevent the user’s personal information from being leaked or damaged, and is using an advanced cryptographic communication method to make sure that the user’s personal information is transferred safely through the network. In addition, the company is using a 24-hour anti-intrusion system to block unauthorized access from external sources, and is striving to introduce all kinds of advanced technical measures to ensure a high level of safety.</p> 
                    <h5 class="mt-4 pl-2">C. Minimizing the Number of Employees Handling Personal Information & Training Programs</h5>
                    <p> The company has minimized the number of employees who have access to the user’s information. A
                        separate password is given to each of those employees, and the passwords are updated on a regular basis to maximize security. Also, the company is emphasizing the importance of following a strict personal information processing procedure/policy through frequent training. In addition, all employees are forced to sign a ‘Security Pledge’ before they handle the user’s personal information to prevent leakage. The company has also prepared a strict set of internal procedures/regulations regarding the handling of personal information to monitor the entire process.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-4 pl-2">D. Operation of a Dedicated Organization</h5>
                    <p>
                        Through a dedicated department that specializes in the monitoring of the handling of personal
                        information/privacy, the company is making the best effort to ensure that the employees who are in charge of handling personal information are following internal policies/regulations and correct the problem immediately whenever an issue occurs. However, the user’s own efforts are also important in the management of personal information. Only those who knows the correct ID/PW have the right to access to the company’s online services, and the responsibility to protect the passwords is also on the users. The user must create a password based on information that only he/she knows, and the user MUST avoid creating passwords that can be easily figured out by others (i.e., birthday, social security number, etc.) Also, if you have logged in to the company’s service from a public PC (i.e., company, library, etc.), make sure to LOG OUT from the service and close the browser before you leave. Otherwise, there is a high risk that your ID, PW, and personal information will be leaked to others through the browser. The company SHALL NOT be held responsible for any problems caused by the illegal/fraudulent use of personal information (i.e., ID, PW, Resident Registration Number, etc.) leaked due to the user’s carelessness or other issues related to the Internet/network.
